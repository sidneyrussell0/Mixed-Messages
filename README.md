Mixed Messages Portfolio Project
==
The prompt for this project was to build a random message/string generator. My idea flourished to become something a bit more fun therefore I created a battle match generator that is themed after Nintendo's Mario.

This battle match generator will randomly select:
- your character
- your opponent
- a power-up item
- the result of your match (win/lose) 

Although simple I think it is unique way to show off a randomized generator.

In order to use this this project you will need Node.js .
